{"files": [], "description": "We built a playground for people to try out Linux. We are tired of customer complaints about malicious fork bombs rummaging the server, hogging system resources, and bringing everything down to a crawl, so we built our own proprietary fork-bomb protector.

Bye bye, RCEs!\n\nAttachments: [nofork.py](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1092893082250379291/1104203870076420138/nofork.py)\n\nConnect via: `socat FILE:$(tty),raw,echo=0 TCP:nofork.sdc.tf:1337`", "author": "k3v1n", "points": null, "id": "d2884d40-3dad-4906-8dc9-2642345bd5d1", "name": "Fork bomb protector (100)", "category": "MISC", "solves": null}
