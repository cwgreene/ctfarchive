{"files": [], "description": "We made an online \u201cRock Paper Scissors\u201d game, where we ask the client to input its move before our server do, since client is untrusted but the server is. This prevents cheats, but some skeptics are paranoid that our server is tweaked so that it may (with a small probability) change its move depending on what the client put, essentially cheating the game. To deal with those skeptics who don\u2019t trust our server, we started using a cryptographic commitment scheme where the client can finally hide its move from the server while still committing to that move before the server gives its move. This sounds like a fair plan, isn\u2019t it?\n\nAttachments: [client.py](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1092893082250379291/1104211154739417098/client.py) [server.py](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1092893082250379291/1104203220697485312/server.py)", "author": "k3v1n", "points": null, "id": "e836d46e-6a3a-49dd-8b5c-adeb0e32cbc2", "name": "Rock paper scissors (350)", "category": "CRYPTO", "solves": null}
